# Financial modeling practices
This is a personal practices for financial engineering especially options pricing. The pricing models I utilized include Black-Scholes, Binomial Trees, and Monte Carlo simulation models. The programming language is Python.

The option pricing practices include path independent options (simple option, rainbow option) and path dependent options (lookback option, arithmetic average option).
